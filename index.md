Home of future updates and my personal projects for the Star Wars 5th Edition system. This website will be ever changing and is by no means fully official, so use anything here at your own risk.

There are many pages on this site that are still a work-in-progress. Such pages will have a 

CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS 
{: .label .label-red } 

tag posted at the top of their page or next to the specific item, rule, or feature that is still being worked on.

If you encounter any typos, bugs, or pages located in the wrong sections, please let me know on the SW5e Discord <br>(please provide screenshots and links to the page you're encountering the issue).
