# Weapons
Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a vibroweapon or a blaster, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring. The Weapons tables show the most common weapons used in the worlds of *Star Wars*, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as a blaster, lightweapon, or vibroweapon. A vibroweapon or lightweapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a blaster is used to attack a target at a distance. Lightweapons are generally used in melee, but due to their nature require separate proficiency.

### Weapon Proficiency
Your species, class, feats and other features can grant you proficiency with specific weapons, weapon groups or sub-groups of weapons. 

The two main categories are Melee Weapons and Ranged Weapons which are broken down further into Weapon Groups, described later in this section. Most people can use simple weapons, which are commonly seen in the hands of the unspecialized, with proficiency. Martial weapons, such as bladed lightweapons, crushing vibroweapons or rifles; require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use these weapons because they put their fighting style and training to best use. 

An example of this is a Martial Lightsaber is a specific weapon of the Bladed sub-group of the Martial Lightweapon weapon group.

Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.

### Improvised Weapons
Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is close at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead jawa.

In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such however creatures are not profienct with them unless they have a feature that gives them proficiency in improvised weapons, such as Brawler Style.

At the GM's discretion, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus. An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 kinetic damage. If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.

### **Unarmed Strikes**
Regardless of whether or not you are armed, you can make a melee weapon attack called an Unarmed Strike: a punch, kick, head--butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, you deal kinetic damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your Unarmed Strike.

(GM note)
Additionally, some class features or customization options utilize weapons or attacks with weapons; such as Force Imbuement or Defense Mastery; as well as some items; such as Modifiable Handwraps; can add weapon properties to Unarmed Strikes. Consider allowing these features, effects, and weapon properties to be made with Unarmed Strikes
