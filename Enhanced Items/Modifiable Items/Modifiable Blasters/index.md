<br> *Prerequisite:* Has strength and lacks mighty property

The strength property of this weapon becomes the dexterity property, retaining the same number it had previously. If a modification or feature reduces the strength property of this weapon, it instead reduces the dexterity property.

Additionally, when making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your your Strength modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
