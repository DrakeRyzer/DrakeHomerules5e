This modifiable vibroweapon comes with vacant modification slots for vibroweapon modifications. It can house modifications of standard rarity.

### Adaptive Counterweight

<br> *Prerequisite:* Has dexterity and lacks finesse and heavy properties

The dexterity property of this weapon becomes the strength property, retaining the same number it had previously. If a modification or feature reduces the dexterity property of this weapon, it instead reduces the strength property.

Additionally, when making an attack with a weapon with this property, you use your your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls.
