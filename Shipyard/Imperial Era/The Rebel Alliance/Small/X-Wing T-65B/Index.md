The T-65B X-wing starfighter was a single-seat craft manufactured by Incom Corporation and used most famously by the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Renowned for its speed and maneuverability in battle, it became the backbone of the Rebel Alliance Starfighter Corps, being both harder hitting and tougher under fire than its main adversary, the mass-produced TIE/ln space superiority starfighter.

***Twin-Linked - Twin Laser Cannon (Front)***: If the X-Wing attacked with its Twin Laser Cannon, it can make an attack with its second Twin Laser Cannon using a bonus action.

(Crewed Astromech) ***Astromech Socket:*** Once per round on its turn, the X-Wing's astromech can Patch or make an Intelligence (Astrogation) check as a bonus action.

#### **Reactions**
(Pilot) ***Pinpoint Strike:*** (2/recharge) When the X-Wing occupies the same square occupied by a target ship and makes an attack roll, as a reaction, the X-Wing can, before rolling the attack, roll a d6, and add it to the attack roll. If the attack requires a saving throw instead, it may subtract d6 from the target's save result. On a hit or a failed save, the attack deals normal damage that bypasses any shields and directly hits the hull of the target ship. This feature can only be used once per round.

(Pilot) ***Retro Thrusters:*** (1/recharge) When the X-Wing is dealt damage from a ship weapon, it can use its reaction to immediately move up to 50 feet in a direction of its choice, halving the damage it takes. The orientation of the ship does not change.
