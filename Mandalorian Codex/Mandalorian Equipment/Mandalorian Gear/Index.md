### Mandalorian Manacles
*Adventuring Gear [(binders)](https://sw5e.com/loot/adventuringGear/?search=Binders), <font style="color:lime">premium</font>*

Escaping the binders requires a successful DC 30 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 30 Strength check. Each set of binders comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with security kit can pick the bindersâ€™ lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check. Binders have 40 hit points.

*A type of binders that used beskar iron in their construction.*

While wearing these gloves, your Strength score becomes 21. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than 21, it has no effect on you.

***Mandalorian Vestments:*** While you are attuned to and wearing two or more enhanced items that have this named property, you gain additional properties as shown on page 20 under Mandalorian Vestments.

*The crushgaunt (or shuk'orok in Mando'a) was a gauntlet designed to augment its wearer's strength.*

### Repulsor Gauntlet
*Adventuring Gear (forearm), <font style="color:gray">standard</font> <font style="color:silver">standard</font>*

The gauntlet has 5 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action it on a creature within melee range or reaction, which you can take when you are hit by a melee attack, to expend 1 of its charges to activate it. A creature must make a DC 13 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 kinetic damage and if the creature is Medium or smaller, it is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.

The gauntlet regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges after a long rest.

*Weaponized repulser technology that creates shockwaves capable of repelling enemies*
