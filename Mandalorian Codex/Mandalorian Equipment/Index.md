Many pieces of Mandalorian equipment come with the "Mandalorian Vestments" trait which gives the wearer the following bonuses, dependent on the amount of items they are attuned with.

### Mandalorian Vestments.
While you are attuned to and in contact with multiple Enhanced items with this named property, you gain the following additional benefits:

- **2 Piece: At least one item of premium rarity or rarer:** 
  - You gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight within 60 feet. If you would already have this effect, increase the range to 120 feet. 
  - This set grants a +1 bonus to AC.

- **3 Piece: At least one item of prototype rarity or rarer:**
  - You gain an additional attunement slot as well as advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks within 5 feet.
  - You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from unEnhanced sources.

- **4 Piece: At least one item of advanced rarity or rarer:**
  - Damage that you take from weapons is reduced by 6. If this would reduce the damage to 0, the damage is instead reduced to 1.
  - You have resistance to kinetic and energy damage from Enhanced sources.
