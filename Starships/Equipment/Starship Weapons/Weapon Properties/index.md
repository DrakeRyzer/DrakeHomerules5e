## Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. 

Weapons with the ammunition property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range property varies based on the weapon type.

### Auto
Automatic weapons only fire in burst or rapid mode.

### Burst
When you would make a ship weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a 150-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition or overheating the weapon equal to the burst number. Each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon’s normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one ship that would be affected by it. If the ship fails its save, in addition to the weapon’s normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If the targeted area is beyond normal range but within long range, affected targets have advantage on the save.

### Brutal
When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the brutal property, you roll a number of additional weapon damage dice equal to the brutal number.

### Constitution
A weapon with this property requires more hull structure to safely operate. While firing it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Constitution requirement.

### Concussive
When a ship is dealt damage by a weapon with the concussive property, a crewmember must succeed on a Constitution saving throw for each ongoing positive effect affecting the ship, on a failure the effect ends. Additionally, creatures inside are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

The DC for these checks equals 10 or half the damage taken by the ship, whichever number is higher.

### Heavy
When you hit with an attack roll with this weapon, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1).

### Hidden
You have advantage on Charisma (Swindle) checks made to conceal a hidden weapon.

### Homing
The target of a weapon with the homing property can not have advantage on the saving throw against this weapon. 

### Ionizing
When you hit a starship with a weapon with the ionizing property, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, the starship takes an additional 1d4 ion damage and becomes ionized until the end of its next turn.

Once per round, as an action, a crew member on the ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Ships larger than you have advantage on the saving throw and ships two sizes larger or more than you also reroll one of the dice once.

### Melt
When you hit a starship with a weapon with the melt property, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, the starship takes an additional 1d8 fire damage and the attack ignores its damage reduction.

### Keen
When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

### Overheat
You can use a weapon that has this property to make a ranged attack a limited number of times equal to the overheat property. 

A character must then cool the weapon using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).  A weapon will also naturally cool over a period of ten minutes of non-use. 

### Precise
Before you make a weapon attack or force a saving throw with a weapon with the precise property, you can choose to gain an additional bonus to the attack roll or saving throw DC up to your proficiency bonus (your choice). If you do so and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.

### Range
Weapons with the Range property come with a range list on the Ship Weapons tables later in this chapter. The range lists two numbers. The effect of these two numbers varies based on the weapon type.

### Rapid
When you would make a ship weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition or overheating the weapon equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon’s damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If the target is beyond normal range but within long range, it has advantage on the save.

### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A crew member must then reload it. Reloading a weapon takes 1 minute per ammunition

### Saturate
When making an attack with a weapon with saturate, you use your choice of your Strength or Wisdom modifier for the attack roll or save DC.

### Special
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

### Vicious
Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.

### Zone
Rather than using power or ammunition, weapons with the zone property are activated with an action and persist until deactivated (no action required), if the weapon has more than one arc, you must choose one. Additionally, the weapon creates a zone of difficult terrain within normal range of the weapon and your ship has advantage on dexterity saving throws against tertiary weapons launched outside normal range.
