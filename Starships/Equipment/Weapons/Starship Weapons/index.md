### Special Tertiary Ammunition.

#### Diamond Boron Missile
A diamond boron missile detonates at a point within range, each ship within 200 [400] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A ship takes 5d10 [10d10] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Discord Missile
On a failed saving throw, the missile deploys pistoeka sabotage droids on the target. At the end of each of the target ship’s turns, the target ship gains one level of system damage if the target is medium or smaller [large or smaller]. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship attempt their choice of a dexterity or constitution saving throw (DC 15), ending the effect on a success.

#### Conner Net Missile
On a failed saving throw, a conner net deploys on the target, which must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

#### Flechette Torpedo
A Flechette torpedo detonates at a point within range, creating a 200 [400] foot cube of difficult terrain.  Any ship entering or starting their turn in this area must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 1d8 [2d8] kinetic damage.

#### S-Thread Tracer Missile
On a failed saving throw, the missile latches an S-thread tracer onto the target. When making an Intelligence (Probe) check to detect the S-threaded ship's hyperspace travel, its angle of departure can be detected on a roll of 15 instead of 25. 

## Quaternary Starship Weapons

When installing a tertiary weapon to a size Tiny ship, reduce the reload number by half. 

When installing a tertiary weapon to a size Medium ship, double the reload number. 

When installing a tertiary weapon to a size Large Ship, quadruple the reload number.

|Name|Cost|Damage|Reload|Properties|
|:---|---:|:---|:---|:---|
| Bomb deployer |7500 cr| Varies | 4 |Ammunition|

### Quaternary Ammunition

|Name|Cost|Weight||Name|Cost|Weight|
|:---|---:|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Bomblets        | 1200 cr | 16 lb || Gravity mine      | 2000 cr | 30 lb |
| Conner net mine | 2000 cr | 30 lb || Proton bomb       | 2100 cr | 32 lb |
| EMP bomb        | 2300 cr | 45 lb || Proximity mine    | 2200 cr | 32 lb |
| Glop bomb       | 2000 cr | 30 lb || Pulse bomb        | 2300 cr | 35 lb |
| Gravity bomb    | 2200 cr | 40 lb || Seismic charge    | 2000 cr | 30 lb |

### Quaternary Ammunition Descriptions
Quaternary weapons require ammunition and, while fire-able by the same bomb deployer, vary greatly in function. Regardless of their function, all quaternary ammunition have 1 hull point, an AC of 20, and upon destruction they detonate. 

The damage value is appropriate for Tiny ships, while the value in parentheses is appropriate for Huge ships. For other ship sizes, scale the cost and die by reducing or increasing it, as explained in "Weapons by Size".

#### Bomblets
When a bomblet detonates, each ship within 50 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Conner Net Mine
On a failed saving throw upon detonation, a conner net deploys on the target, which must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  

#### EMP Bomb
When an EMP bomb detonates, each ship within 150 feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  

#### Glop Bomb
When a glop bomb detonates, each ship within 50 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

#### Gravity Bomb
Rather than exploding on contact, gravity bombs detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity bomb detonates, it attaches itself to the closest ship hull within 50 feet, creating a mass shadow centered on the ship with a radius of 50 feet that lasts for 10 minutes.  A ship can attempt to dislodge the gravity bomb at the beginning of each ship turn by making a Strength saving throw (DC 15). Any Large or smaller [Gargantuan or smaller] ships with an attached gravity bomb are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

#### Gravity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, gravity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity mine detonates, it creates a mass shadow centered on the point of detonation with a radius of 50 feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any ships touching this mass shadow are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

#### Proton Bomb
When a proton bomb detonates, each ship within 100 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 4d10 energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Proximity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, proximity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a proximity mine detonates, each ship within 100 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Pulse Bomb
When a pulse bomb detonates, each ship within 200 feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 ion damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

#### Seismic Charge
When a seismic charge detonates, each ship within 150 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
