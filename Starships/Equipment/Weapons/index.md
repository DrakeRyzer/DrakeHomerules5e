## Weapons
Ships have weapon categories based on their determined function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. In order to install a weapon, your ship must have a vacant fixed or turret hardpoint modification.

Ship weapons are divided into four categories: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Properties vary based on the weapon's category.

In order to install a weapon onto a starship, the ship must have a vacant hardpoint modification onto which the weapon is installed. The hardpoint modification may be upgraded with a mounting type which can add new firing arcs (turret mounting, or broadside mounting modifications) or add a new way of firing (fire-linked mounting) to the weapon installed onto that hardpoint, as described in ***Chapter 3: Modifications***.

#### Weapon Installation: Start to Finish
If your ship already has a vacant hardpoint, then you can simply install a weapon onto the hardpoint per the equipment installation rules described in this chapter and the process is complete.

If your ship does not have any vacant hardpoints, then you must first purchase and install a hardpoint. If you want your weapon to have an unlimited firing arc, e.g., you purchase and install a hardpoint modification and a turret mounting modification (which has, as a prerequisite, the hardpoint modification). After installing the hardpoint per the modification installation rules in Chapter 3, you can now install the new weapon onto the hardpoint.


Ships have weapon categories based on their function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. 

### Primary Weapons
Primary weapons are the most common type that smaller ships carry: laser cannons. If a medium or smaller ship has any weapons, it has laser cannons. Laser cannons vary in effective range, rate of fire, damage, and damage type.

In a Huge or larger ship, primary weapons are de-ployed in arrays called point-defense systems. Rather than being Fired, point-defense systems are activated via their zone keyword and call for Dexterity saving thr-ows (DC = 8 + the crew member’s proficiency bonus + the ship’s Wisdom modifier) to avoid the weapon's eff-ects which apply to all ships entering or beginning their turn in range of the point-defense system. 

If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage. A ship can not activate more than one type of point-defense weapon in any given firing arc.

***Range.*** The first number is the primary weapon's **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the primary weapon's **long range**. When attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. 

In a Huge or larger ship, when attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's **long range**. 

### Secondary Weapons
Secondary weapons are typically railguns or a small turbolaser on Large or smaller ships.  On Huge and larger ships, secondary weapons are the most common type of weapon, and typically take the form of turbolaser batteries. These weapons deal more damage and have a longer range than primary weapons, but they are more cumbersome. They are a common addition to gunships. 

In a Huge or larger ship, you have disadvantage to hit Large and Medium ships and cannot target Small or Tiny ships with secondary weapons.

***Range.*** The first number is the secondary weapon's **close range** in feet, and the second number indicates the secondary weapon's **normal range**. When attacking a target within **close range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. If you would already have disadvantage because a Huge or larger ship is firing at a Large or Medium ship, you roll the higher die a second time. When attacking a target beyond **close range**, but within **normal range**, you make the attack roll unaltered. You can't attack a target beyond the secondary weapon's **normal range**. 


### Tertiary Weapons
Tertiary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of missiles, rockets or torpedoes. These weapons often have a long range, high accuracy, and massive damage potential but they are limited use and expensive to obtain. X-Wings are typically outfitted with proton torpedoes, for example. 

Rather than attack rolls, tertiary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.  On a die result of "1" the weapon scores a critical hit.

Ships two or more sizes smaller than you have advantage on the saving throw.  Ships two or more sizes large than you have disadvantage on the saving throw.

***Range.*** The first number is the tertiary weapon's **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the tertiary weapon's **long range**. When attacking a target with a tertiary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the tertiary weapon's **long range**.  

### Quaternary Weapons
Quaternary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of bombs, charges, and mines. These weapons deal massive damage, but travel at slow speeds, and are costly to acquire. Y-Wings are typically outfitted with proton bombs.

Rather than attack rolls, quaternary weapons call for saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

When released, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving at the start of the firing gunner's turn. Quaternary weapons detonate when they physically connect with an object, when the firing gunner detonates them remotely using their reaction, or 1 minute after they are deployed.

When a deployed crew member takes the Fire action with a quaternary weapon, they can release a single loaded piece of ammunition. 

***Range.*** Quaternary weapons do not have a range. Instead, when Firing a quaternary weapon, the crew member chooses whether to drop the ammunition in place or to launch the ammunition.  If launched, the ammunition travels in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round.

### Weapon Properties
Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.

#### Ammunition
You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. 

Weapons with the ammunition property come with a range in parentheses after the property. The range property varies based on the weapon type.

#### Auto
Automatic weapons only fire in burst or rapid mode.

#### Burst
When you would make a ship weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead spray a 150-foot-cube area within range with shots, consuming ammunition or overheating the weapon equal to the burst number. Each ship in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon) or take the weapon’s normal damage. Before you use this property, you can declare one ship that would be affected by it. If the ship fails its save, in addition to the weapon’s normal damage, it is subjected to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If the targeted area is beyond normal range but within long range, affected targets have advantage on the save.

#### Brutal
When you score a critical hit with a weapon with the brutal property, you roll a number of additional weapon damage dice equal to the brutal number.

#### Constitution
A weapon with this property requires more hull structure to safely operate. While firing it, you have disadvantage on attack rolls unless you meet the Constitution requirement.

#### Concussive
When a ship is dealt damage by a weapon with the concussive property, a crewmember must succeed on a Constitution saving throw for each ongoing positive effect affecting the ship, on a failure the effect ends. Additionally, creatures inside are forced to make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

The DC for these checks equals 10 or half the damage taken by the ship, whichever number is higher.

#### Heavy
When you hit with an attack roll with this weapon, you deal additional damage equal to half your Strength modifier (rounded up, minimum of +1).

#### Hidden
You have advantage on Charisma (Swindle) checks made to conceal a hidden weapon.

#### Homing
The target of a weapon with the homing property can not have advantage on the saving throw against this weapon. 

#### Ionizing
When you hit a starship with a weapon with the ionizing property, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, the starship takes an additional 1d4 ion damage and becomes ionized until the end of its next turn.

Once per round, as an action, a crew member on the ship can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Ships larger than you have advantage on the saving throw and ships two sizes larger or more than you also reroll one of the dice once.

#### Melt
When you hit a starship with a weapon with the melt property, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + prof. bonus + ship’s Strength modifier). On a failed save, the starship takes an additional 1d8 fire damage and the attack ignores its damage reduction.

#### Keen
When you make a weapon attack with a weapon with the keen property, the critical hit range increases by an amount equal to the keen number.

#### Overheat
You can use a weapon that has this property to make a ranged attack a limited number of times equal to the overheat property. 

A character must then cool the weapon using an action or a bonus action (the character's choice).  A weapon will also naturally cool over a period of ten minutes of non-use. 

#### Precise
Before you make a weapon attack or force a saving throw with a weapon with the precise property, you can choose to gain an additional bonus to the attack roll or saving throw DC up to your proficiency bonus (your choice). If you do so and you hit with it, you suffer an equivalent penalty to the damage roll.

#### Range
Weapons with the Range property come with a range list on the Ship Weapons tables later in this chapter. The range lists two numbers. The effect of these two numbers varies based on the weapon type.

#### Rapid
When you would make a ship weapon attack with a weapon with this property, you can instead unload on a single target, consuming ammunition or overheating the weapon equal to the rapid number. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your bonus to attacks with the weapon). On a failed save, roll the weapon’s damage dice twice and add them together, adding relevant modifiers as normal and subjecting the target to any additional effects that would occur on a hit. If the target is beyond normal range but within long range, it has advantage on the save.

#### Reload
A limited number of shots can be made with a weapon that has the reload property. A crew member must then reload it. Reloading a weapon takes 1 minute per ammunition

#### Saturate
When making an attack with a weapon with saturate, you use your choice of your Strength or Wisdom modifier for the attack roll or save DC.

#### Special
A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see "Special Weapons" later in this section).

#### Vicious
Whenever you deal damage with a weapon with the vicious property and roll the maximum on a weapon damage die, you gain a bonus to damage equal to the vicious number.

#### Zone
Rather than using power or ammunition, weapons with the zone property are activated with an action and persist until deactivated (no action required), if the weapon has more than one arc, you must choose one. Additionally, the weapon creates a zone of difficult terrain within normal range of the weapon and your ship has advantage on dexterity saving throws against tertiary weapons launched outside normal range.

## Weapons by Size
In addition to the cost of the weapon varying by size, the damage dice and reload value for ammunition based weapons vary as well. There are two tables showing the various primary and secondary weapon that can be added to ships. The first is for size Tiny to Large ships, and the second is for size Huge to Gargantuan ships. A third table lists the types of tertiary and quaternary weapons and ammunition that can be installed and used.

### Tertiary and Quaternary Weapons

#### Ship Weapons (Tiny-Large)
When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Tiny ship, reduce the reload number by half. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Medium ship, double the reload number. When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Large Ship, quadruple the reload number.

For instance, a Rocket Pod Launcher for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 6; for a size Medium ship has a reload of 24. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Tiny ship has a reload of 2; for a size Medium ship the Bomb Deployer has a reload of 8.

The damage done by tertiary ammunition for ships sized Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large is shown in the "Damage" column of the Tertiary Ammunition table.  The number in parentheses is only used for ships sized Huge and Gargantuan.

#### Ship Weapons (Huge & Gargantuan)
When scaling a tertiary or quaternary weapon to a size Gargantuan ship, double the reload number. 

For instance, an Assault Rocket Pod Launcher for a size Gargantuan ship has a reload of 48. Meanwhile, a Bomb Deployer for a size Gargantuan ship has a reload of 16.

The damage done by tertiary ammunition for ships sized Huge and Gargantuan is shown in parentheses in the "Damage" column of the Tertiary Ammunition table.  The number outside the parentheses is only used for ships size Tiny, Small, Medium, and Large.

## Ammunition 
Tertiary and quaternary weapons require ammunition.  Values in brackets apply to Huge and larger ships.

### Tertiary/Quaternary Ammunition.

#### Conner Net
On a failed saving throw for a missile or upon detonation for a mine, a conner net deploys on the target, which must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  

### Tertiary Ammunition.
The ammunition for tertiary weapons varies based on the specific type of launcher attached to the hardpoint.

#### Diamond Boron Missile
A diamond boron missile detonates at a point within range, each ship within 200 [400] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw. A ship takes 5d10 [10d10] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Discord Missile
On a failed saving throw, the missile deploys pistoeka sabotage droids on the target. At the end of each of the target ship’s turns, the target ship gains one level of system damage if the target is medium or smaller [large or smaller]. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship attempt their choice of a dexterity or constitution saving throw (DC 15), ending the effect on a success.

#### Flechette Torpedo
A Flechette torpedo detonates at a point within range, creating a 200 [400] foot cube of difficult terrain.  Any ship entering or starting their turn in this area must succeed at a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15) or take 1d8 [2d8] kinetic damage.

#### S-Thread Tracer
On a failed saving throw, the missile latches an S-thread tracer onto the target. When making an Intelligence (Probe) check to detect the S-threaded ship's hyperspace travel, its angle of departure can be detected on a roll of 15 instead of 25. 

### Quaternary Ammunition. 
The ammunition for quaternary weapons, while fire-able by the same bomb deployer, vary greatly in function. Regardless of their function, all quaternary ammunition have 1 hull point, an AC of 20, and upon destruction they detonate. 

The damage value is appropriate for Tiny ships, while the value in parentheses is appropriate for Huge ships. For other ship sizes, scale the cost and die by reducing or increasing it, as explained in "Weapons by Size".

#### Bomblets
When a bomblet detonates, each ship within 50 [100] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 [2d10] energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### EMP Bomb
When an EMP bomb detonates, each ship within 150 [300] feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is stunned for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  

#### Glop Bomb
When a glop bomb detonates, each ship within 50 [100] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, a ship is blinded for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

#### Gravity Bomb
Rather than exploding on contact, gravity bombs detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity bomb detonates, it attaches itself to the closest ship hull within 50 [100] feet, creating a mass shadow centered on the ship with a radius of 50 feet that lasts for 10 minutes.  A ship can attempt to dislodge the gravity bomb at the beginning of each ship turn by making a Strength saving throw (DC 15). Any Large or smaller [Gargantuan or smaller] ships with an attached gravity bomb are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

#### Gravity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, gravity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a gravity mine detonates, it creates a mass shadow centered on the point of detonation with a radius of 50 [100] feet that lasts for 10 minutes. Any ships touching this mass shadow are unable to activate their hyperdrives.

#### Proton Bomb
When a proton bomb detonates, each ship within 100 [200] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 4d10 [8d10] energy damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Proximity Mine
Rather than exploding on contact, proximity mines detonate any time a ship comes within range of it. When a proximity mine detonates, each ship within 100 [200] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 [4d10] fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Pulse Bomb
When a pulse bomb detonates, each ship within 200 [400] feet must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 2d10 [4d10] ion damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, it is ionized for 1 minute. As an action on each of their turns, a crew member can have the ship repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.  Ships larger than you have advantage on their saving throw.

#### Seismic Charge
When a seismic charge detonates, each ship within 150 [300] feet must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 15). A ship takes 1d10 [2d10] kinetic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
