## Weapons
Ships have weapon categories based on their determined function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. In order to install a weapon, your ship must have a vacant fixed or turret hardpoint modification.

Ship weapons are divided into four categories: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Properties vary based on the weapon's category.

In order to install a weapon onto a starship, the ship must have a vacant hardpoint modification onto which the weapon is installed. The hardpoint modification may be upgraded with a mounting type which can add new firing arcs (turret mounting, or broadside mounting modifications) or add a new way of firing (fire-linked mounting) to the weapon installed onto that hardpoint, as described in ***Chapter 3: Modifications***.

#### Weapon Installation: Start to Finish
If your ship already has a vacant hardpoint, then you can simply install a weapon onto the hardpoint per the equipment installation rules described in this chapter and the process is complete.

If your ship does not have any vacant hardpoints, then you must first purchase and install a hardpoint. If you want your weapon to have an unlimited firing arc, e.g., you purchase and install a hardpoint modification and a turret mounting modification (which has, as a prerequisite, the hardpoint modification). After installing the hardpoint per the modification installation rules in Chapter 3, you can now install the new weapon onto the hardpoint.


Ships have weapon categories based on their function. Most snubfighters use laser cannons, while gunships have both railguns and lasers. Specialized ships often carry torpedoes or missile batteries, or even a bomb deployer. 

### Primary Weapons
Primary weapons are the most common type that smaller ships carry: laser cannons. If a medium or smaller ship has any weapons, it has laser cannons. Laser cannons vary in effective range, rate of fire, damage, and damage type.

In a Huge or larger ship, primary weapons are de-ployed in arrays called point-defense systems. Rather than being Fired, point-defense systems are activated via their zone keyword and call for Dexterity saving thr-ows (DC = 8 + the crew member’s proficiency bonus + the ship’s Wisdom modifier) to avoid the weapon's eff-ects which apply to all ships entering or beginning their turn in range of the point-defense system. 

If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage. A ship can not activate more than one type of point-defense weapon in any given firing arc.

***Range.*** The first number is the primary weapon's **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the primary weapon's **long range**. When attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. 

In a Huge or larger ship, when attacking a target with a primary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's **long range**. 

### Secondary Weapons
Secondary weapons are typically railguns or a small turbolaser on Large or smaller ships.  On Huge and larger ships, secondary weapons are the most common type of weapon, and typically take the form of turbolaser batteries. These weapons deal more damage and have a longer range than primary weapons, but they are more cumbersome. They are a common addition to gunships. 

In a Huge or larger ship, you have disadvantage to hit Large and Medium ships and cannot target Small or Tiny ships with secondary weapons.

***Range.*** The first number is the secondary weapon's **close range** in feet, and the second number indicates the secondary weapon's **normal range**. When attacking a target within **close range**, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. If you would already have disadvantage because a Huge or larger ship is firing at a Large or Medium ship, you roll the higher die a second time. When attacking a target beyond **close range**, but within **normal range**, you make the attack roll unaltered. You can't attack a target beyond the secondary weapon's **normal range**. 


### Tertiary Weapons
Tertiary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of missiles, rockets or torpedoes. These weapons often have a long range, high accuracy, and massive damage potential but they are limited use and expensive to obtain. X-Wings are typically outfitted with proton torpedoes, for example. 

Rather than attack rolls, tertiary weapons call for Dexterity saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.  On a die result of "1" the weapon scores a critical hit.

Ships two or more sizes smaller than you have advantage on the saving throw.  Ships two or more sizes large than you have disadvantage on the saving throw.

***Range.*** The first number is the tertiary weapon's **normal range** in feet, and the second number indicates the tertiary weapon's **long range**. When attacking a target with a tertiary weapon beyond **normal range**, they have advantage on the saving throw. You can't attack a target beyond the tertiary weapon's **long range**.  

### Quaternary Weapons
Quaternary weapons are limited-use weapons in the form of bombs, charges, and mines. These weapons deal massive damage, but travel at slow speeds, and are costly to acquire. Y-Wings are typically outfitted with proton bombs.

Rather than attack rolls, quaternary weapons call for saving throws to avoid the weapon's effects. If the target fails the saving throw, they take the weapon's normal damage. On a successful save, they take half of the weapon's normal damage.

When released, quaternary weapons travel in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving at the start of the firing gunner's turn. Quaternary weapons detonate when they physically connect with an object, when the firing gunner detonates them remotely using their reaction, or 1 minute after they are deployed.

When a deployed crew member takes the Fire action with a quaternary weapon, they can release a single loaded piece of ammunition. 

***Range.*** Quaternary weapons do not have a range. Instead, when Firing a quaternary weapon, the crew member chooses whether to drop the ammunition in place or to launch the ammunition.  If launched, the ammunition travels in a straight line at a rate of 100 feet per round.
