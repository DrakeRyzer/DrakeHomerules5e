## Ship Power
Ships have different power generation, distribution, and storage systems based on their energy consumption needs. Excess power can be used to fuel special abilities.

### Power Dice
Crewmembers can use a ship's power die to fuel special abilities granted by ranks in a particular deployment role.  A power die is expended when a crewmember uses it, and can be used when stored in the system listed in the ability or in central storage.

The size of your ship’s power dice is determined by your ship’s tier, as shown below in the **Starship Tier Power Die Size** table. 

Your ship’s maximum power dice and how your power dice are stored are determined by your ship's power coupling.  How many power dice it recovers each turn is determined by your ship’s reactor. Additionally, a ship's Reactor starts at full capacity at the beginning of combat.

##### Starship Tier Power Die Size

| Starship Tier  | Power Die Size | Starship Tier  | Power Die Size |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  0  | d2 |  3  | d8 |
|  1  | d4 |  4  | d10 |
|  2  | d6 |  5  | d12 |

### Reactors
Every starship comes with a single main reactor of varying types based on their intended uses. While the majority of commercial ships use standard reactors with average performance characteristics, some ships use more specialized reactor systems for fuel efficiency or raw power.

***Power Die Recovery.*** At the start of each of your ship’s turns, it recovers a number of expended power dice, as shown in the Power Dice Recovery column of the **Reactors and Power Couplings** table below. Each power die is distributed a single storage (central, communications, engines, shields, sensors, and weapons) and is determined by the Helmsman or discussed amongst the party.
#### Fuel Cell Reactor
Fuel cell reactors are the most common and balanced reactors on the market.

#### Ionization Reactor
Ionization reactors are highly fuel-efficient reactors that trade power output for fuel economy.

#### Power Core Reactor
Power core reactors have highly variable power output capabilities, but sacrifice fuel economy as a result.

|Type|Cost|Fuel Use Modifier|Power Dice Recovery|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|	_Reactors_	||||
|Fuel cell reactor  |4,500 cr| -    |1|
|Ionization reactor |5,100 cr| x 0.5|1d2-1|
|Power core reactor |5,750 cr| x 1.5|1d2|


### Power Coupling
Different power couplings are used in ships, often based on the number of crew expected to operate the ship. Each starship has one type of power coupling and there are three power coupling models in standard usage: direct power coupling, distributed power coupling, and hub & spoke power coupling.
These power dice are stored in a central and/or individual system capacitors to power abilities of crewmembers.  

***Power Die Storage.*** Your ship’s maximum power dice are determined by its storage, as shown in the two storage columns of the **Reactors and Power Couplings** table below. Power dice stored centrally can be used by any deployment abilities, while those stored in specific systems can only be used by abilities that reference that system. There are five systems used by Deployment abilities: communications, engines, shields, sensors, and weapons. Each system has its own storage capacity in distributed and hub & spoke architectures.

#### Direct Power Coupling
Direct power coupling has a central power capacitor that feeds power directly to each system.

#### Distributed Power Coupling
Distributed power coupling sacrifices flexibility by allocating power separately to each system.

#### Hub & Spoke Power Coupling
A hub and spoke coupling system combines attributes of both other systems, providing some flexibility and some increased power storage capacity. 

|Type|Cost|Central Capacity|System Capacity|
|:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|	_Power Couplings_	||||
|Direct coupling       |4,100 cr|4|-|
|Distributed coupling  |5,100 cr|-|2 (per system)|
|Hub coupling  |5,600 cr|2|1 (per system)|
