# Movement and Position
In combat, ships are in constant motion, often using movement and positioning to gain the upper hand.

## The Pilot
Every starship has a single Pilot, determined at the beginning of a starship's turn, who controls the movement and turning of their piloted starship.

## Starship Facings
All Vehicles have four facings; front, left right, and rear, and can normally only move in the direction they are facing (front) or rotate about their center.

## Starship Movement
Starships come equipped with two values used for movement: Flight Speed and Turning Radius. A ship’s unmodified Flight Speed and Turning Radius are determined by its size, as selected at construction in Chapter 3: Starships.

### Flight Speed
Flight Speed is how far your starship can travel in a single round. It is expressed in feet. For every foot your starship travels forward, it expends one foot from its speed.

While you are the pilot of a starship, on your turn, can move the starship a distance up to its Flight Speed. The starship can use as much or as little of its Flight Speed as desired, following the rules above.

### Turning Radius
Turning Radius determines how maneuverable your starship is while turning in a single round. It is expressed in degrees. For every degree your starship travels forward, it expends one degree from its Turning Radius.

Whenever a Pilot would move a starship using its Flight Speed, they can spend up to thier starship's Turning Radius to rotate the starship.

> Typically games are played with turning limited to 90 degree increments, but, if your group has the desire and capability to track smaller angles, this is allowed.

In order for your starship to rotate 90 degrees, you must spend an amount of your Flight Speed equal to your Turning Radius. For instance, if your starship has a Flight Speed of 350 feet, and a Turning Radius of 100 feet, you can travel 150 feet in a straight line, spending 150 feet of your Flight Speed, and then turn 90 degrees to starboard, spending 100 feet of your Flight Speed, leaving 100 feet of movement remaining.



A starship can turn more (or less, if your group agrees) than 90 degrees on its turn, by spending a proportionate amount of movement.

If a ship’s Turning Radius exceeds its Flight Speed, that starship cannot turn 90 degrees, in combat conditions, absent another effect modifiying the ship’s Turning Radius and/or Flight Speed or the Hard Turn action.

A ship’s unmodified Turning Radius is determined in Chapter 3: Starships by the Role selected for the starship at construction.

BREAKING UP YOUR MOVE
The crewmember at the helm can break up your ship’s movement on its turn, using some Flight Speed before and after various crew actions. For example, if your starship has a speed of 300 feet, it can move 100 feet, two players can take actions, and then it can move 200 feet.

MOVING BETWEEN ATTACKS
If you take an action that includes more than one starship attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a starship that can make two attacks and that has a speed of 300 feet could move 100 feet, make an attack, move 200 feet, and then attack again.

DIFFICULT TERRAIN
Combat rarely takes place in featureless terrain. Asteroid fields, mountain ranges, other ships—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.

Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.

MOVING AROUND OTHER SHIPS
You can move through a ship’s space. However, you can end your turn on a ship’s space only if the starship is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Another ship’s space is difficult terrain for your starship.

VARIANT: PLAYING ON A GRID
If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules.
Squares. Each square on the grid represents 50 feet.
Facing. Each starship has a facing: the direction to the adjacent square the vehicle is pointing toward. This means that a starship in a given square has eight possible facings.
Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid. This means you use your speed in 50-foot segments. This is particularly easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 50. For example, a speed of 300 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares.
If you use a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.
Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement left, unless the square is diagonally adjacent to your square (see below).
Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of an asteroid or other terrain feature that fills its space.
Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two entities, start counting squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.
Diagonals. When measuring range or moving diagonally, the first diagonal square counts as 50 feet, but the second diagonal square counts as 100 feet. This pattern of 50 feet and then 100 feet continues whenever you’re counting diagonally, even if you move horizontally or vertically between different bits of diagonal movement. For instance, a starship might move one square diagonally (50 feet), then three squares straight (150 feet), and then another square diagonally (100 feet) for a total movement of 300 feet.

starship SIZE
Each starship takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a starship of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same categories.

SIZE CATEGORIES
Size	Space
Tiny	Up to 25 ft.
Small	25 to 50 ft.
Medium	50 to 250 ft.
Large	250 to 2,500 ft.
Huge	2,500 to 10,000 ft.
Gargantuan	10,000 ft. or larger
VARIANT: SIZES ON A GRID
If you play out combat using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, consider scaling down the sizes of ships. A Tiny or Small starship should take up 1 square, while a Medium starship takes up 2. A Large starship takes up 4 squares, a Huge 8, and a Gargantuan 16.

SPACE
A ship’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium starship isn’t 100 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide.
