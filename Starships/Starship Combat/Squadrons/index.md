# Squadrons
Squadrons are formations of two to six **Tiny**, **Small**, or **Medium** starships that act as a single unit, greatly speeding up large battles. Any ship that is **Proficiently Equipped** in the **Manuevering** skill can join a Squadron by moving into an adjacent space as a willing allied starship of the same size (no action required), becoming a Squad Member or the Squad Leader (explained further below). The Squadron then acts on the Initiative count of last Starship to join the first round it is created, occupying a space one size category larger on the battle grid.

## Creating a Squadron
Joining a Squadron ends your movement and actions for the round; any unused actions (including readied actions) are lost. At the beginning of a Squadronâ€™s turn, any ship can choose to delay their Initiative order to one point after the Squadron's Initiative order to leave the Squadron.

The Squadron's Leader (designated by mutual consent) makes all the decisions and actions for the Squadron. Once the leader of a Squadron is chosen, it can be changed once at the start of the Squadron's turn to another ship in the Squadron. When the first Starship joins another to form the Squadron, the first leader is chosen at that time.

## Uses of a Squadron
Squadrons can use Actions, Bonus Actions, or Reactions only if every Squad Member of the Squadron is able to do so. When an action is used, every Squad Member of the Squadron uses that action at the same time. Members of a Squadron also cannot use features that involve movement unless all ships in the Squadron are able to do so. However, the Squadron Leader can use additional features, such as the Pilot/Ace tactic *Target Acquired* or the Gunner gambit *Crippling Shot*, can be added to an attack or an action that does not involve movement without the other starship's in the Squadron requiring it.

If a Squad Member of the Squadron has an active effect when it joins the Squadron, those effects are lost. If all ships when a Squadron is created, or when a new ship joins it, are under the same effects, they retain those effects as a Squadron. (the Squadron is, itself, like one starship).

The following bonuses and negatives affect the Squadron

- The Squadron uses the Squadron Leader's ability modifiers, proficency bonus, and decides which skills they are profienctly equipped in.
  
  - Rather than making attacks, each Squad Member within a Squadron automatically gives advantage and a +1 bonus to attack rolls per Squad Member to the Squad Leader's attack rolls. If the Squadron would already have advantage on an attack, they can reroll one of the dice once.
  
  - For every two points by which the attack roll exceeds the target's Armor Class, or for every two points under the target fails their Saving Throw; the target is hit by another weapon in the Squadron of the same type (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, or Quaternary), up to the total Squad Members in the Squadon. For every Squad Member weapon that hits, add additional damage equal to one of that Squad Member's weapon's damage dice, but they do not add their damage modifier.

- However the Squadron uses the worst Armor Class, Damage Reduction, Flight Speed and Turning Speed of the Squadron and they have disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws to stay in formation. 

- When attacked, the Squadron Leader may either designate a starship operated by an NPC crew as the target or determine the target randomly. 
  - If an undamaged Squad Member's Shield and Hull points are reduced to 0, any excess damage carries over to another Squad Member, applying any remaining damage to it. If that Squad Member was also undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged Squad Member to 0 hit points.

- Gains advantage and a +1 bonus per additional Squad Member on any ability checks made, including those made as part of actions. If the Squadron would already have advantage on an ability check, they can reroll one of the dice once

# Gameplay Example
Gold Five moves their Y-Wing to an adjacent space to Red One's X-Wing. Gold Five then can choose to join Red One (no action required) and losing the rest of their actions for that round to create a Squadron. Both ships then agree that Red One is the Squadron Leader.

Gold Five had the Boost Engines action active when they joined the Squadron and Red One did not, so they lose that effect upon joining Red One. Additionally Gold Five's Intiative order was 15, so the Squadron's Initiative order is now 15. (If another ship joins later, the Squadron's Initiative order remains at 15.)

The Squadron, led by Red One this round, uses Red One's X-Wing for their ability modifiers, proficency bonus of +3, and decides which skills they are profienctly equipped in, as well as their X-Wing's Damage Reduction of 3. However they use Gold Five's Y-Wing for the Squadron's Armor Class of 10, Turning Speed of 150. Red One's X-Wing also had their S-Foils unlocked, making both ships have the same Flight Speed of 450.

At the start of the Squadron's turn, Red One moves the Squadron 50 feet forward and turns them 90 degrees to the left to face the oncoming TIE Squadron of five TIE/LN Starfighters. The TIE Squadron is within 200 feet, so Red One moves the Squadron 150 feet forward (250 feet remaining) before taking the Dogfight action. They make an opposed Dexterity (Maneuvering) check with advantage and a +1 bonus against the TIE Squadron. 

On the prior round, the TIE Fighter Squadron won the contest for their own Dogfight action. However Red One's Squadron wins this contest, which causes their next attack to no longer suffer disadvantage due to the TIEs's earlier win. 

Red One decides to attack with their Twin Laser Cannon as part of the Dogfight action. They roll an 11, adding thier +7 to attacks and +1 from being in a Squadron with Gold Five for a attack roll of 19. The attack hits and exceeds the TIE Fighter Squadron's Armor Class of 14 by 5, which means Gold One gets to add their Laser Cannon's damage dice to the attack, but not their damage modifier. 

Red One's Squadron rolls 1d8 + 2 (Red One's Twin Laser Cannon) + 1d10 (Gold Five's Laser Cannon) and deals 16 energy damage. This is enough damage to destroy one of the TIE Squadron's Squad Members completely, leaving them at a Squadron of 4, and dealing an additional 2 energy damage to another Squad Member. As both Red One and Gold Five have the Fire-Linked Mounting modification, Red One then uses the Squadron's Bonus Action to fire their second Twin Laser Cannon and Gold Five fires their linked Ion Cannon, repeating the process. At the end of the attack, Red One moves the Squadron their remaining 250 feet forward, putting them behind the TIE Squadron.
