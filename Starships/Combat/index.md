# Starship Combat


As the light freighter exits hyperspace, it finds itself in the middle of a snubfighter skirmish. Immediately, the pilot begins evasive maneuvers while hollering for help. One crewmember hops into the copilot seat while two more run to opposite sides of the craft to man the gun batteries. Three of the snubfighters—now identified as TIE fighters—turn towards this new opponent and open fire, but the blasts dissipiate ineffectually on the freighter’s shields. The freighter’s two gunners, now in place, open fire on the assaulting craft. One takes the blasts directly to the cockpit and explodes in a blaze, while the other is hit on a solar panel and spins off out of control into the distance. The third attempts to pass overhead, but the copilot takes a shot from the freighter’s slaved railgun and destroys the fighter in a single stroke.

This chapter provides the rules you need for your characters and their craft to engage in space combat, whether it is a brief skirmish or an extended conflict. Throughout this chapter, the rules address you, the player or GM. The GM controls all the other ships and nonplayer characters involved in space combat, and each other player controls either their own ship or a function of your ship. “You” can also mean the character or ship you control.
The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter is a clash between two sides, a flurry of cannon shots and ship maneuvers. The game organizes the chaos of combat into a cycle of rounds and turns. A round represents about 6 seconds in the game world. During a round, each participant in a battle takes a turn. The order of turns is determined at the beginning of a combat encounter, when everyone rolls initiative. Once everyone has taken a turn, the fight continues to the next round if neither side has defeated the other.
Surprise

An assault carrier exits hyperspace and immediately begins firing on its prey. Fighters rapidly exit bays to support and protect the craft. Their opponents, caught unawares, are slow to respond and take significant damage before mounting their defense. In this situation, one side of the battle gained surprise over the other.

The GM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the GM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any ship that doesn’t notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.

If you’re surprised, you can’t move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can’t take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren’t.

    Combat Step By Step

    1. Determine surprise. The GM determines whether
    anyone involved in the combat encounter is surprised.
    2. Establish positions. The GM decides where all
    characters and ships are located.
    3. Roll initiative. Every PC on a ship rolls initiative
    normally, and the lowest initiative on each ship sets
    the initiative for that ship.
    4. Start a ship turn. When your ship activates based on the initiative order, the ship’s reactor replenishes power dice and the crew determines how these dice are distributed through the power coupling. The crew should also decide if they want to activate their shield generator’s regeneration at the start of the ship’s turn. All PCs on a ship then take their
    individual turns on their ship’s turn in an order agreed
    upon by the crew for that ship turn. In case of
    disputes, the helm has final say. The order of character
    turns on a ship’s turn may change from round to
    round.
    5. Take turns. Each ship in the battle takes a
    turn in ship initiative order.
    6. Begin the next round. When every ship involved in the
    combat has had a turn, the round ends. Repeat step 5
    until the fighting stops.
