# Starship Actions

## Starship Turns

A starship has a limited amount of Crewmember Turns that can be taken each round, detailed below.

- **Tiny** starships have an amount of Crewmember Turns determined by their Droid Brain, Remote Override, or Piloting Chamber modification.
- **Small** starships have an amount of Crewmember Turns equal to their Maximum Crew Capacity. This can be increased with the Astromech Socket, Co-pilot Seat, and Crew Expansion modifications.
- **Medium, Large, Huge, and Gargantuan** starships have 5 Crewmember Turns. Additionally, crewmembers can lock in as ship gunners at the start of a starship's turn. Ship gunner's actions are limited to activating Ship Weapons and making Ship Weapon Attacks however they do not count against their starship's Crewmember Turns.

All characters on a starship take their individual Crewmember Turns at the start of their starship’s turn in an order agreed upon by the crew for that ship turn. The order of character turns on a ship’s turn may change from round to round.

### Maximum Ship Weapon Activations

While a ship can have any number of hardpoints, it's crew can only activate Ship Weapons a number of times each round equal to the ship’s Strength modifier (minimum of +1) times its Weapon Activations Size Modifier (round up), as shown in the Ship Hardpoint Size modifier table below. Normally each weapon can only be Fired once per round.
Weapon Activations Size Modifier
|Ship Size|Size Modifier|
|Tiny| 	1|
|Small| 	1|
|Medium| 	1.5|
|Ship Size|Size Modifier|
|Large| 	2.5|
|Huge| 	2|
|Gargantuan| 	3|

> ### Variant: Simultaneous Actions
> Rather than each crewmember taking their turns in an order agreed upon by the crew, some campaigns may want to allow a starship's crew to act simultaneously. Using this variant rule, crewmembers can take actions in any order without needing to wait for another crewmember's turn to end.

The “Movement and Position” section gives the rules for starship movement and the "Starship Crew" section gives rules for further managing a starship crew.

## Action Types

There are five types of "actions": Actions, Bonus Actions, Reactions, Object Interactions, and Free Actions.

Each active crewmember can make one Action, one Bonus Action, one Reaction, one Object Interaction, and an unlimited amount of Free Actions each round. and are regained at the start of a creature's turn.

These actions are shared with and used alongside a creature's normal actions from The Player's Handbook.

### Actions

You may take one action on your turn, and any action taken by a player with l your ship can only be taken once per round unless otherwise stated. For example, although two different crewmembers could both cast the same
force power or make an ability check  with the Medicine skill, they could not both take an action granted by a ship modification or the Boost Engines action, described below. 

Only the active pilot can take pilot actions, but all other actions may be taken by anyone on the ship as logic dictates.

### Bonus Actions

Various class or deployment features, powers, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. You can only take a bonus action if some feature gives you one, and you can only take one bonus action on each of your turns.
Other Activity on Your Turn

Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.

You can communicate however you are able as you take your turn.

You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action.

### Reactions

Certain features allow you to take a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur any turn.

When you take a reaction, you can’t take another one until the start of your starship's next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.

### Object Interactions

### Free Actions

## Actions in Combat

When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here; an action you gained from your class, specialization, or some other feature; an action granted by a ship modification; or an action that you improvise.

When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.

Actions possible by a given character in a given circumstance are determined by the GM as logic dictates. For example, a snub-fighter control system allows for all actions to be useable from the cock-pit. In Large and larger ships, players typically control a crew that carries out their actions, and, therefore, need not worry about which precise equipment is right in front of them. In medium ships, things are most complicated. Only one player may normally take helm actions: the player in the pilot seat. However, if disabled, a co-pilot may be able to immediately take over without switching stations. Typically, other crew stations are general purpose, allowing
any non-restricted actions to be taken at them.

### Free Actions in Combat

At the start of a starship's turn, the crew rolls to recover thier Power Dice and decide which Power Coupling Capacity to store them. 

They may also decide if they want to activate their starship's Passive Shield Regeneration.

In case of disputes, the active pilot has final say.

## Pilot Actions

The following Actions can only be taken by the active pilot of a starship. Only one Pilot action can be taken per turn unless otherwise stated.

Some pilot actions have prerequisites. If a starship does not meet the prerequisites, the active pilot cannot use that action.

### Attack Run
*Prerequisite:* Tiny, Small, or Medium starship

When you move at least 150 feet towards a target, you may declare an Attack Run as an action. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). If you finish this movement within range of your target, you may follow it with one of the following options:

***Fire.*** You may make a ship weapon attack from a forward-facing limited arc without suffering the normal disadvantage. If you attack with a tertiary or quaternary weapon, the attack deals additional damage equal to the distance of your attack run divided by 50, up to your ship’s Strength modifier (minimum of 1).

***Ram.*** You may make a Ram attempt with advantage on your Strength (Ram) check. If you succeed, the target ship takes additional damage equal to the distance of your Attack Run divided by 50, up to your ship’s Constitution modifier (minimum of +1).

### Conceal

When you take the Conceal action, you make a Dexterity (Hide) check in an attempt to Conceal your ship, following the rules in chapter 7 for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the “Unseen Attackers and Targets” section later in this chapter.

### Dogfight
*Prerequisite:* Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large starship

When you engage a single enemy, you duck and weave, vying for a good shot while avoiding theirs. You choose a target and make an opposed Dexterity (Maneuvering) check. On a success, you cause the next attack made against your ship by the target to suffer from disadvantage, but you grant the next attack made against your ship by a different target advantage. Additionally, you can perform a primary or tertiary weapon attack from a forward facing limited firing arc against that ship without suffering the normal disadvantage.

### Evade

When you take the Evade action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any Attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker on your instruments, and you make Dexterity Saving Throws with advantage.

This action affects your entire ship: any ability check or
attack made by your ship or anyone on it has
disadvantage until the end of your ship’s next turn. The effects of Evade end if you are Incapacitated or if your speed drops to 0.

### Fly

When you take the Fly action, you gain extra Movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers.

With a speed of 300 feet, for example, your ship can move up to 600 feet on its turn if you Fly. Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional Movement by the same amount. If your ship’s speed of 300 feet is reduced to 150 feet, for instance, your ship can move up to 300 feet this turn if you Fly.

This action affects your ship’s ability to stay on target: any ability check or attack made by your ship or anyone on it has disadvantage until the end of your ship’s next turn.

### Harass

You can harass an enemy and lock them into a series of close-combat maneuvers in order to prevent their escape. When you take the harass action, make an opposed Dexterity (Maneuvering) check against a target within one size category of you and within normal range of at least one of your forward facing primary weapons. This weapon cannot be Fired this turn. On a success, if the target voluntarily leaves it’s square before the beginning of your next turn, it takes damage as though it suffered a critical hit with the primary weapon used to harass.
Hard Turn

When you take the Hard Turn action, you coax your ship into a tight maneuver, turning your ship 90 degrees without expending any of your flying speed.
Ram

You can attempt to ram another ship while flying through its space. When you take the ram action, you make a Strength (Ram) check opposed by the target’s Dexterity (Maneuvering) check. On a failed check the ramming action fails. On a success, both you and the target ship take kinetic damage equal to two of your ship’s Hull Dice + your ship’s Strength modifier. If your ship has shield points remaining, your ship instead takes half this damage.
Interfere

You can attempt to interfere with another creature within 1,000 feet, in the attempt of a task. When you take the Interfere action, you make a Charisma (Interfere) check contested by the target’s Wisdom (Scan) check. If you succeed, the subject has disadvantage on the next ability check or attack roll it makes before the start of your next turn. The Interfere action can be taken multiple times on a ship’s turn.

### Boost

You can attempt to boost a function of your ship. Each function can only be boosted once on each of the ship’s turns, and each time you try to boost a function of the ship after the first, the DC increases by 5, cumulatively, until the start of your next turn.
Boost Engines

You can attempt to boost your speed. When you take the Boost Engines action, you make a DC 10 Strength (Boost) check. On a success you increase your speed by 50 until the end of your ship’s next turn.
Boost Shields

You can attempt to boost your shields. When you take the Boost Shields action, you make a DC 10 Strength (Boost) check. On a success, you roll a shield die, without expending it, and gain temporary shield points equal to the result that last until the start of your ship’s next turn.
Boost Weapons

You can attempt to boost your weapon output. When you take the Boost Weapons action, the next time this turn your ship would deal damage, you make a DC 10 Strength (Boost) check. On a success, you have advantage on the damage roll.
Detect

When you take the Detect action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your detection, the DM might have you make a Wisdom (Scan) check or an Intelligence (Probe) check.
Direct

When you take the Direct action, the creature gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn. Alternatively, you can direct a friendly creature that can hear you in attacking another target. If your ally attacks the target before the start of your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage. The Direct action can be taken multiple times on a ship’s turn.
Fire

The most common action to take in combat is the Fire
action. With this action, you can make an attack (or
attacks) with one ship weapon. See the
"Making an Attack" section for the rules that govern
attacks. The Fire action may be taken multiple times
on a ship’s turn, but normally only once per weapon. A crewmember Firing from the helm has disadvantage on attack
rolls with primary and secondary weapons.

    Want more Crunch?

    Although outside the scope of these rules, some play groups may want a more lore-friendly take on ship combat where only certain actions (whether base actions, actions given by ship modifications, or actions gained through deployment ranks) can be taken at certain ship stations. If so, players and GMs are encouraged to agree to a ship layout that includes these stations along with a list of options that are either allowed or disallowed at that station. A separate battle-mat can be used to track PC location on a ship during ship combat, if desired.


Patch

You can attempt to patch up damage a ship has taken, using one of its Hull Dice. When you take the Patch action, you make a Constitution (Patch) check (DC = 10 or half the ship’s missing hull points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you roll the Hull Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a success you roll the Hull Die normally. The Patch action can be taken multiple times on a ship’s turn.
Regenerate Shields

You can attempt to regenerate your shields faster, spending one of your Shield Dice. When you take the Regenerate Shields action, you make a Strength (Boost) check (DC = 10 or half the ship’s missing shield points, whichever number is higher). On a failure, you roll the Shield Die twice and take the lesser amount. On a success you roll the Shield Die normally. The Regenerate Shields action can only be taken once each ship turn.
