# Ship Combat
Combat between starships is a deadly and unforgiving game, for the loser is subjected to the lifeless, infinite void of space.

Ship combat follows most of the same rules and conventions as ordinary combat; for example, ships follow an initiative order and generally play on a 2D plane. Ship movement is covered in the Pilot role and ship attacks are covered in the Gunner role. The Captain, Dogfighter, and Engineer roles are optional; a captain provides extra actions to the crew, the engineer manages power flow and shields, and a dogfighter detaches from the main ship to target the weak points on enemy craft.

## Initiative
When ship combat begins, each character must take a role on the ship to participate. A character's actions with regards to the ship are limited to the role they choose. Entire enemy ships act on a single turn of the initiative order, whereas individual characters act separately. However, if a character is in the role of the Captain, the entire crew can act on a single turn of the initiative order. 

## Character Roles
Each character on a starship chooses one of the following roles when they roll initiative. Depending on the ship, some roles, such as Gunner, might be occupied by one character, more than one character, or might not exist at all. By contrast, roles like Pilot are usually occupied only by one character. A character can switch roles with another character or can switch to an unoccupied role as an action.

### Captain
As the captain, you direct the ship's operations and manage the crew. If you choose to be the captain when the ship rolls initiative, you roll initiative for the entire ship. The entire party acts on that turn in the initiative order while you are captain, and you can choose in which order the crew members take their turns. If you leave the Captain role or fall unconscious, the party rolls initiative separately at the end of the next initiative order.

As a captain, you can use the following actions:

#### Boarding Party.
When the conditions for Boarding are met, you can use your action as the captain to form a boarding party (which you can choose to be a part of) and deploy the umbilicus.

#### Brace for Impact.
You can use your action to brace the ship for damage. Each time your ship takes damage before the beginning of your next turn, you can roll 1d6 and subtract the number rolled from the mega damage your ship takes, to a minimum of 1.

#### Deep Scan.
If your ship is equipped with sensors, you can use your action to order a deep scan of a specific object of interest within range of the sensors. This allows you to make an Intelligence (Investigation) check to examine that object.

#### Fire at Will.
You use your action to declare a barrage. One gunner of your choice can then use its reaction to make one attack with a ship weapon.

#### Full Speed Ahead.
You use your action to push the engines. The pilot can then use its reaction to move the ship half its movement within the cone of movement.

### Engineer
As the engineer, you can direct power around the ship and position the ship's directional shield. By default, the shield is forward-facing and active. The ship's shield covers only one of the ship's four sides. As a bonus action, you can switch the direction the shield faces. If an attack hits the ship on its shielded side, damage is subtracted from the ship's shield points, rather than its hit points. At the beginning of the initiative order, the shield regains half its maximum shield points, rounded up. As an engineer, you have the following actions available to you:

#### Directing Power
You can use your action to deactivate the shield and direct its power elsewhere: either to the impulse engines or into one of the ship’s weapons. If you invest the power in the ship’s engines, the ship’s movement speed increases by half until the beginning of your next turn. If you invest the power in one of the ship’s weapons, a gunner can make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action. 

Alternatively, you can draw power from the ship’s weapons and invest it in the ship's shields. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, the ship's shields cover two of its consecutive sides, instead of only one, and it regains all of its shield points at the beginning of the initiative order, instead of only half. In exchange, each gunner makes one weapon attack fewer than normal when they take the Open Fire action.

#### Overcharge
If you are a spellcaster, you can use your action to expend a spell slot with a level greater than or equal to the Dark Matter engine's class to overcharge the engine. The shield recharges completely, and until the beginning of your next turn, power is invested in the ship’s engines (increasing the ship’s movement speed by half) and every gun (allowing each gunner to make one additional attack using that weapon when they take the Open Fire action on their turn). Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again for 1 minute.

#### System Repair
You can use your action to repair a ship system or weapon that has 0 hit points and is deactivated. When you do so, make a DC 15 Intelligence (Technology) check. On a success, the system or weapon regains 1 mega hit point and reactivates at the beginning of your next turn. 

#### Void Jump
You can begin the charging process for a void jump. Once a Dark Matter engine has begun to charge, it will jump in 1 minute. No intervention can stop or slow this process; once it is begun, nothing short of destroying the ship can interrupt the jump. The pilot is responsible for guiding the ship on the jump itself and rolls on the Blind Jump table when the jump begins.


### Gunner
Acquiring targets and calculating ranges, you fire the shipboard weapons on hostile targets. Many ship weapons don't have any facing rules, but those which do are normally mounted to the front or to one of the sides of the ship. If a weapon has the Facing property, it can only be fired in a 90-degree cone in the direction in which it was mounted.

While you are in the Gunner role, you can only operate one of the ship’s weapons at a time. You can use a bonus action on your turn to switch between weapons. You add your proficiency bonus and Dexterity modifier to an attack roll you make with a ship’s weapon, but you don't add any ability modifier to the weapon’s damage rolls. Weapon entries in the Example Ships section include an example attack bonus, to be used only if the GM controls the ship as an NPC.

As a gunner, you can take the following actions:

#### Open Fire
You can take the Attack action on your turn to attack with one of the ship’s weapons. You can make multiple attacks with this weapon if you have a feature, such as Extra Attack, that gives you extra attacks. If you score a critical hit on a ship, you randomly disable one of the target ship's systems.

#### Readied Attack
You can use your action to ready an attack with a ship’s weapon, just as you would ready an attack with a normal weapon. Often, this readied action  is used to target deployed weapons, such as neutron torpedoes, the moment they are launched, or to strike another ship the moment it opens fire.

#### Targeted Attack
While you are within 1,000 feet of another ship, you can use your action to attempt to disable one of that ship’s systems. When you do so, make an attack targeting the ship with disadvantage. On a hit, you deal damage directly to a system of your choice, a weapon of your choice, or the ship’s impulse engines. If the attack is blocked by a shield, the damage is subtracted from the target ship’s shield points before it damages any system. Systems, weapons, and engines have 10 mega hit points each. Damage to systems is also deducted from the target ship’s hit points.

If a system or weapon drops to 0 hit points, it is disabled. Any creature operating a weapon when it is destroyed takes normal damage (as opposed to mega damage) equal to the damage dealt. If the engines drop to 0 hit points, the ship is crippled and can only move at half speed.

### Pilot
As the pilot, you navigate and direct the ship's movement. Each ship has a given speed in hundreds of feet per turn, and a maneuverability score, which is given in degrees. Additionally, each ship faces a particular direction, which is normally in 45-degree intervals, and can be approximated using the eight cardinal directions. To approximate momentum, each ship's movement is limited to a cone of movement, which extends in the direction your ship is facing and is as wide as the ship’s Maneuverability score, measured in degrees.

As the ship’s pilot, you can use the following actions:

#### Move
You use your action to move the ship up to its speed within the ship’s cone of movement. Once you have finished moving, you can rotate the direction your ship is facing by up to its maneuverability score.

#### Evasive Maneuvers
If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to perform evasive maneuvers instead of moving normally. When you do so, until the beginning of your next turn, you add your Dexterity modifier to the ship's AC and have advantage on Dexterity saving throws you make on behalf of the ship.

#### Dogfighting
If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller and a ship of the same size classification is behind you within 1,000 feet, you can use your action to perform a complex maneuver. Make a Dexterity (Piloting) check, contested by the other ship. On a success, following several tight turns, you switch places with that ship. The direction both ships face remains the same.

#### Hard Turn
If your ship is Corvette-sized or smaller, you can use your action to pull a hard turn, rotating your ship almost on the spot. You move your ship 500 feet in any direction and rotate to face any way you choose.

#### Match Speed
Your ship attempts to move at the same rate and direction as another ship instead of moving normally. Choose one ship that you can see. Until the beginning of your next turn, your ship moves when that ship does and attempts to maintain the same distance from it and angle to it. If the target ship moves faster, is more maneuverable, or uses Hard Turn to perform a movement you are not normally capable of, this effect ends.

#### Ram
If your ship is Frigate-sized or smaller (and you feel particularly foolhardy), you can ram your ship directly into a target by moving up to your speed within your cone of movement and entering a ship or mega creature’s space. Your ship and the target each take 2d10 mega bludgeoning damage. Larger ships deal and take more damage in a ram: Transport ships deal 3d10, Corvettes and Frigates deal 4d10.
